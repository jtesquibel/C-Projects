Innside hw_jesquibel I have a hw8 folder, which has another hw8 folder, and then finally a hw8qt folder. Go all the way to the hw8qt folder to find the Makefile. To make just to the standard qmake -project, qmake, make.

For the bells and whistles, I chose to do partial keyword search. Searching a string of 3 characters or greater promts a partial keyword search on the database.

Thank you very much for a great semester
